	<description>Anomaly entities require vast space and long-term stable colonies,
while Odyssey forces you to constantly relocate within the cramped confines of a starship.
No more compromises! This mod provides solutions—seamlessly bridging both DLCs!

All Anomaly events and entities—from Flesh Beasts to Spheres of Torment—can now appear in space.

Grav Ship-Themed Anomaly Rituals: Power your starship with dark psychic energy.
Entity Autopsy Table: Dissect monster corpses to earn Anomaly research points.
Golden Cube Avian: The perfect Golden Cube, evolved—into the world's finest pet.

The Void Monolith now follows you—everywhere. Even into the heart of the Mechanoid Hive Mind's territory. Fully activating it there will trigger a chaotic, multi-path ending.</description>
